When you're creating new DRSF entries, or editing existing DRSF entries, you'll be working within this directory.  Note: if you're working collaboratively with a team when building your DRSF, your Git pull will already have this directory present and full of documentation.\n",
    "* `DRSF_SOURCE_DOCS_STAGING_DIR`: The staging directory to view the outputs of the DRSF codebase's changes to the original source documentation of the DEV directory explained just above.

This file's contents contain critically important configurations and mappings that ensure the proper instantiation and operation of the DRSF and all its respective entries.  You'll see `drsf_base_config_mappings` passed as a parameter to several DRSF objects and many helper functions.\n",

    "\n",
    "<!-- TODO: Content within this section remains a work in progress. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in the publication process is to deploy the DRSF source content in your DEV \\(`DRSF_SOURCE_DOCS_DEV_DIR`\\) directory to your STAGING \\(`DRSF_SOURCE_DOCS_STAGING_DIR`\\) directory.  This kicks off a complicated chain of actions in the DRSF codebase.  The following is a general summary of what happens.\n",
    "1. All DRSF entry source document files are parsed, and a list of `DRSF_Entry` objects is created.\n",
    "2. That list of entries is then used to instantiate a `DRSF` object.\n",
    "3. The DRSF's database is created from the list of DRSF entries, and entry associations \\(e.g. populating a threat's \"proceeding attacks\"\\) are processed.\n",
    "4. The DRSF's master graph is then built from the DRSF database.  Further DRSF metrics may be calculated at this time, and written back into the database.\n",
    "5. Once the `DRSF` object's database and graph have run through all their operations, the resulting DRSF entry associations and calculated metrics are then written back into the DRSF entry source documents in the STAGING directory.  This stage involves in-line changes to those myst-markdown documents, as well as a few other complicated operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you may be asking yourself an important question...  **Why even have a staging directory?  Why not simply validate the DRSF documents in the dev directory, and then just build the Jupyter book right there?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The first reason is that we need to edit DRSF documents in-line before a Jupyter book is built from them.  For example, when you created a new DRSF entry document from a template file, you may have noticed a section that said \"Automated Documentation Section\".  These sections are automatically edited by the DRSF codebase for a variety of reasons.  Just one example is the automatic insertion of links to related DRSF entries: such as \"Preceeding Attacks\", \"Associated Detection Signatures\", etc.  When we're creating our new DRSF entries and building them up, we want to make it clear to the contributor that those sections should not be manually edited.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second reason is that when the DRSF documents are pushed to staging, the DRSF codebase completely removes the Foundational Build Syntax section from each entry's myst-markdown document.  While this section is critically important when building our DRSF and its documentation, it is not useful for the SOC Analyst or executive who's reading the final  DRSF Jupyter Book published product.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all these in-line changes to these STAGING source documents, we want to keep the two collections of source documents completely separate.  If we were also making changes to the drsf codebase itself - changing how the dev source documents were edited - then changing source documents in a separate staging directory instead of the original dev directory would be critically important.
