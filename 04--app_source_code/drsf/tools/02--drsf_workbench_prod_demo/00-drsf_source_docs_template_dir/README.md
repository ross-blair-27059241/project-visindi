## What is This Directory?

This directory contains all the content comprising a Detection & Response Strategic Framework \(DRSF\).  It's in this directory that you'll build your DRSF.


## How to Use This Directory?

The directory is structured such that a Jupyter Book can be built from it.  Before a Jupyter Book can be successfully instantiated from it, we need to ensure that we've retrieved all the content files referenced by the Myst-markdown source documentation.

The directory `01-content_files` contains any content that is referenced by the Myst-markdown source documentation that comprise the Jupyter Book.  **If you've just cloned this project's repository, you may find that this directory is essentially empty!  This is by design, so don't worry and read on.**  Since such files may be very large in size, it may not be practical or cost-effective to have them tracked within the Git file version control system.  You may need to manually retrieve them from their storage location.  See the README file at `./01-content_files/README.md` for all the details.
