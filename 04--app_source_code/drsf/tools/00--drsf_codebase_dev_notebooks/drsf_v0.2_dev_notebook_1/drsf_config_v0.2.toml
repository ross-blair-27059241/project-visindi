[source_doc_ops_directories]
# The relative file path of the target directory where you would like to write
# the "DEV" directory for your DRSF source documents.  Note that this directory
# will serve as your primary workspace when creating and documenting new DRSF
# entries and creating other chapters in your DRSF (e.g. a chapter detailing
# IR playbooks for certain adverse events).
#   * If you create a new DRSF from scratch, this directory will be
#     automatically created for you.

# The relative file path of the target directory that will serve as your DRSF's
# "STAGING" directory.  This directory contains "staging" drafts of your DRSF
# source documents, so that their contents can be reviewed before executing the
# final DRSF documentation build that creates the official DRSF Jupyter Book.
