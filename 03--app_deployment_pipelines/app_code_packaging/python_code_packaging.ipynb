    "\n",
    "As you have probably already noticed, this runbook comes in the form of a Jupyter notebook.  It consists of a mixture of documentation cells and code cells.  The documentation and code cells proceed in a logical order, assuming that you're starting at the very beginning of the code packaging process and proceeding right through to where you've packaged your application and are cleaning up and organizing the resulting outputs.  Generally speaking, these documentation and code cells should be read and/or executed in the order they're presented below, but they do not necessarily need to be.  If you don't need to take a certain action, you can skip the execution of one or more steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each stage in the packaging process begins with a documentation cell with a new section.  Some sections are more \"automated\" \\(i.e. all you have to do is run some code cells to execute the code\\) than others.\n",
