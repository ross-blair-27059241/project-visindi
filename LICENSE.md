> To verify the authenticity of this document with this written signature here, please first refer to the following three peices of information:
>
>   1. The document file which you are reading at this very moment, referred to in this context as the "source file".
>   2. The GPG-public-key-detached-signature-file corresponding to the source file, often referred to as the "signature file".  The signature file bares the same name as its source file plus a ".sig" suffix.  The signature file can be located in the same directory as this source file.
>   3. The OpenPGP standard \(PGP\) key-certificate belonging to the source file's author: [Ross Blair](https://github.com/ross-blair-27059241).  The PGP key-certificate's certifying-primary-key-pair's public-key bares the PGP fingerprint `5089 BF57 0395 FA05 9380  BC80 2C19 753D B797 5FDF`.  Available via Github API [here](https://api.github.com/users/ross-blair-27059241/gpg_keys) or direct download [here](https://github.com/ross-blair-27059241/ross-blair-27059241).
>
> To doubly verify the authenticity of this PGP key-certificate you've just retrieved \(mentioned above in step 3\), check that the PGP fingerprint of that key-certificate's certifying-primary-key-pair's public-key is the same as that fingerprint specified in the account profile of Ross Blair's X \(formerly Twitter\) account: `@rb_27059241`.
>
> With these peices of data/information, and the authenticity of the PGP public key-certificate confirmed, you can move on to the final step of truly verifying this signed document. Download and install the application [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/index.html) - or a derivative program like [GPGTools](https://gpgtools.org). Then use this program to to verify that this file was indeed signed by the holder of the PGP private key corresponding to Ross Blair's PGP public key.  There are two technical steps to this process:
>   1. Import Ross Blair's PGP public key-certificate to your GPG program's keystore.  Run this \(or some very similar\) CLI command: `gpg --import [public-key-file]`.
>   2. Finally, verify Ross Blair's signature on this document. Run this \(or some very similar\) CLI command: `gpg --verify [signature-file-name] [source-file-name]`.
>
> The resulting message from the GPG program on your command line should confirm that the signature is valid, and that this signed document is authentic.
